## Screenshots
(Include some screenshots of the app in both themes here)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd calculator-app
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## How it Works

The app is structured in a single file (`main.dart`) that handles the UI, themes, and logic for performing calculations. The themes are controlled by Flutter’s built-in `ThemeData` class, which allows users to toggle between the light and dark themes.
